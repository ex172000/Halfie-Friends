{"name":"Halfie-friends","tagline":"Android Camera Application","body":"Halfie-Friends!\r\n=====\r\nThis Android application is created with designer Ning Xu.\r\n\r\n#Story \r\n####By Ning Xu\r\nBack in high school, in their age of 16, Jessica and Marina became best friends. They were used to getting together all the time, so when Mariana decided to move to Australia with her parents, they were so frustrated and uncertain about maintaining their friendship. One day after the separation, through video chatting, Mariana introduced an Android app to Jessica. By using this app, two friends far away from each other are able to co-work on a\r\nphotograph. By managing the configuration accordingly and adjusting the shooting angles, those two pictures can stay attached just like one. For example, Mariana takes a picture of the rainy sky in Sydney, and shares it with Jessica via WI-FI. Once she receives Marianaâ€™s message, Jessica takes a picture of the sunny sky in Beijing. During the shooting, she can refer to the picture took by Mariana by having it takes up half of the screen. A notification will be sent to Mariana when the picture is finished. And the app will ask if they want to save or share the final picture to social networks. By cooperating on the creative artworks, even if they are thousands of miles away from each other, Jessica and Mariana feel like they have never been so close before.\r\n\r\n#Technological Detail\r\nThis application began with the framework provided by AndroidHive.
